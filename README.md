# CovidPatientBloodGlucoseMonitor
This system continuously monitors the blood oxygen levels and logs them to the ubidots IoT platform. 
Also, it will send critical medical alerts in the form of voice calls, SMS, EMail, and telegram message to the Hospital management and ambulance driver for seeking help in hard times.
The MAX30100 is complete pulse oximetry and heart-rate sensor system solution designed for the demanding requirements of wearable devices. The MAX30100 pro-vides very small total solution size without sacrificing optical or electrical performance. 
The MAX30100 is fully configurable through software registers, and the digital output data is stored in a 16-deep FIFO within the device. The FIFO allows the MAX30100 to be connected to a microcontroller or microprocessor on a shared bus, where the data is not being read continuously from the deviceâ€™s registers.
